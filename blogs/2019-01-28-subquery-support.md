Introduction As the title suggests, a subquery is a part of a query, and allows you to do a range query within a query, which was not possible before. It has been a long-standing feature request: prometheus/prometheus/1227 . The pull request for subquery support was recently merged into Prometheus and will be available in Prometheus 2.7.
